This is a fork of LXDE's LXRandR project, which seems abandoned since
2016.

The main focus of this is to fix some minor, yet annoying bugs. Here    
we have fixed:
    * Unable to disable unplugged monitors
    * Fallback message not showing up

Please be aware that these two problems was not fixed in a beautiful
way, and therefore some variant of these bugs may occour somewhere.

Notes for compilation: it requires intltool and GTK+ to compile.
